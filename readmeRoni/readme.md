Hi my name is Cheron (shur ron) Parker but I go by Roni (Ronnie). I am not very interesting but that does not matter because I make people happy.
I love guitar and someday I will play it like a pro. I like playing women football. I was originally on offense but I like defense better.
I love to play video games. I am not a big gamer but I so have my fair share of games to play. My favorite genre of games is horror.
I like to sleep. I am a homebody and writing or listening to music is typically my homebody activity. 
I love crime shows. I use to want to be a detective but that being a cop is not the lifestyle for me.
I went to college at Indiana Uviversity. I am from Indiana. I have the strangest earges to get up and leave. To just pack up my things and go.
Thats pretty much it!
